# Anti-Membean Weapon: Juno
<p>The Anti-Membean Weapon has been rebuilt from the ground up! We have added new features that exploit some of membean programming flaws.</p>
<ul><h3>New Features:</h3>
  <li>Chooses the correct answer only 70% of the time! Making your session look much more believable</li>
  <li>Chooses the answer between 3.7 seconds and 13 seconds, the number is different each time it answers!</li>
  <li>Fixed bug where program wouldn't initialize! If the program never worked for you, this was the reason!</li>
</ul>
<strong> Please note that this is intended as a technical demonstration, it is not intended to be used as a way to cheat membean. We do not encourage cheating on membean. By downloading you accept all risk with using this software. We hope this leads to a membean that is resistant of these kinds of "hacks".</strong> 
<p>This program works with membean as of 1/5/16. <strong>It only works for google chrome</strong> and has only been tested on windows.</p>
